# PetroBase.jl

Documentation for the [PetroBase.jl](https://github.com/sc-dyer/PetroBase.jl) package.
This is a basic package with some useful type definitions and functions for petrological modelling. This is intended for use with JPerpleX and other modelling packages I have developed to provide an easy way to interoperate between them.
